Agenda:

1.) Running, horizontal scrolling game
2.) The idea is to auto generate hills that the user has to fly the small ship over
3.) Hitting the top of the game or hitting a mountain results in game over
4.) Print the score to the user 

Implementation:

Classes:

	Utilities -- general, this is a requirement for windows so it is accessible anywhere

	Window -- responsible for controlling the terminal with curses screen

	Colored Window -- extends window and is responsible for controlling colored window

	Hill -- this is the basic hill - it is a self contained element that generates a random hill height / width and creates the coordinates necessary

	Game ground -- this is the game ground generator -- responsible for controlling all of the hills and making them move left 

	Character -- this is the character element -- it is responsible for controlling the character and creating the proper coordinates for its different pieces

	Game_controller -- this is a singleton - like class (not fully implemented), but the idea is to have only one instance. this controls the game and all that goes on with it.

Current Status:

	run make -f game.make to compile the game
	test.cpp -- class tests -- these are not complete right now

	game runs correctly -- but the game ground lags - because of the curses implementation
		-currently, we are redrawing each element
		-future implementation will be to create windows for each hill and then move the windows left
